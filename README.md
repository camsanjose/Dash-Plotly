This app contains the Pokemon dataset which includes about 676 Pokemon with its Type, Total points, Attack, Defense and Speed. You can find three tabs (sections): About, Data and Characteristics. \\

In the 'About' section, you can find a small introduction to the app. Likewise, there is an interactive table where, with a dropdown, you an choose from any Pokemon you want to see all its characteristics (mentioned previously). \\

In the 'Data' section, you can see all of the Pokemon in one table (you can view all of them by clicking on the arrows). This is also an interactive table, were you can click on the box on the Pokemon of your choice, which will make the Pokemon you chose on the graphs below change to the color pink. There are four graphs pertaining to the four types of variables (total, attack, defense and speed). This way, you can see how it compares to the other pokemon. You can also make it so as to sort by type of variable. For example, if you want the total type to be sorted in an incremental manner, you can click on the arrow next to the header of that variable, and that way see where the Pokemon you chose compares to the rest (if it has a very low or high level).\\

In the 'Characteristic' tab, you get a graph that is divided by type of Pokemon. There is a dropdown with all the types of Pokemon you can choose from. There are 18 types: Bug, Dark, Dragon, Electric, Fairy, Fighting, Fire, Flying, Ghost, Grass, Ground, Ice, Normal, Poison, Psychich, Rock, Steel and Water. Later, you can also choose what type of variable you want to see (previously mentioned). The graph shows a scatter plot with the names of the Pokemon that belong to the chosen type and the points of the variable chosen.
